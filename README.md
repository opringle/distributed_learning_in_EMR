1) work out what the best format to store large datasets is

SQL is a great way to sotre rrelational tabular data but using hadoop allows big data analysis.

Need CMBC data as a json.





2) store a local version of the cmbc dataset this way
3) you need to 

I want to do meaningful analysis.This means it will need to be stored locally. That's fine i can get it on my harddisk
I want to do everything on a huge dataset also (4GB of transit data is fine)

store cmbc data in haddop on your machine?

1) need to be training the model in EMR
2) need to be hosting the data in amazon s3 bucket
3) decide whether or not to serialize the model
